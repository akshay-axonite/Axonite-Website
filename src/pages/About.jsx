        Axonite Technologies builds intelligent software that connects
        manufacturing operations, enterprise workflows, and business data,
        helping organizations operate with greater efficiency, visibility,
        and control.

        <br />
        <br/>
        

        Based in India and backed by more than two decades of industry
        experience through our parent company, ShopFloor Automation Inc. in
        Iowa, USA, we combine deep manufacturing expertise with modern
        software engineering and AI-enabled automation to develop practical,
        reliable technology solutions.

        <br />
        <br/>
       

        Our solutions support organizations across the complete operational
        lifecycle, from shop-floor execution and equipment connectivity to
        document processing, ERP integration, technical support, and
        controlled business-process automation. By connecting people,
        processes, and systems, we help businesses streamline operations,
        improve traceability, and make better use of their data.

            <br />
           Our cross-border delivery model combines product strategy and client engagement in the United States with engineering, implementation, and support capabilities in India.
